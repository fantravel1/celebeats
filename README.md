## 🧠 Core Philosophy

CelebEats is **not a blog**.  
It is a **structured knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- expand content
- translate content
- summarize content

Humans are required to:
- verify evidence
- approve confidence levels
- protect ethical boundaries

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

CelebEats is built around **repeatable entity types**.

### Core Entities
- City
- Celebrity
- Restaurant
- Dish
- At-Home Meal
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links to related entities
- can be generated programmatically
